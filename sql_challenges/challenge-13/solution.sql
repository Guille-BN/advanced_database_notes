-- Lesson 08: Exercise — Assignment History
/*A support ticketing system. Tickets get reassigned between agents. You need
to track who was assigned when the ticket was created vs when it was resolved.*/

---

-- Step 1 — Source Tables (OLTP)
--Create two tables:
/*
**`tickets`** — current state of each ticket. Needs:
- ticket_id, title, status, priority, created_at, resolved_at, assigned_to

**`ticket_assignments`** — history of who was assigned when. Needs:
- assignment_id, ticket_id, assigned_to, assigned_by, valid_from, valid_to*/

```sql
-- Your code here
```

---

## Step 2 — Sample Data

Insert at least 5 tickets. Make sure at least one gets reassigned (different
person in `ticket_assignments` than the current `assigned_to` in `tickets`).

```sql
-- Your code here
```

---

## Step 3 — Trigger

Write a trigger on `tickets` that:
- On INSERT or UPDATE of `assigned_to`, logs the change to `ticket_assignments`
- Closes the previous active assignment (sets its `valid_to`)
- Inserts a new row with `valid_from = now()` and `valid_to = NULL`

```sql
-- Your code here
```

**Test it:** Reassign a ticket, then query `ticket_assignments` to confirm
both the old and new assignment are recorded.

---

## Step 4 — Data Warehouse Tables (Star Schema)

Create two tables:

**`dim_agent`** — agent details. Needs: agent_key, agent_name, team

**`fact_ticket_daily`** — daily counts per agent/status/priority. Needs:
date_key, agent_key, status, priority, tickets_created, tickets_resolved

```sql
-- Your code here
```

---

## Step 5 — Populate dim_agent

Insert 3-4 agents with their teams.

```sql
-- Your code here
```

---

## Step 6 — ETL Logic (Colab)

In your Colab notebook, write pandas code that:
1. Extracts `tickets` and `ticket_assignments` from FreeSQL
2. For each ticket, finds who was assigned at `created_at` using:
   `valid_from <= created_at AND (valid_to IS NULL OR valid_to > created_at)`
3. Same for `resolved_at`
4. Groups by date, agent, status, priority and counts
5. Inserts into `fact_ticket_daily`

---

## Step 7 — Verify

Write a query joining `fact_ticket_daily` and `dim_agent` to show tickets
created and resolved per agent per day. The reassigned ticket should show
the original agent for creation and the new agent for resolution.
